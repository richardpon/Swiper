# Swiper
Read standard magnetic strip data from the audio jack of your computer.

This is a really old project and did work at some point. I don't have the hardware anymore so there's no way to verify it.

# Requirements
* [SoX Sound eXchange](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
* Physical magstripe read connected to audio jack of your computer
